    "Getting a computer to do something you want is always a matter of translation, because you and the computer (the bundle of connected hardware, including your display, RAM, hard drive, processor, and GPU) speak different languages. Your computer speaks something called \"machine code\", or one step higher, closely related \"assembly\" language, which is almost impossible for humans to read. If we had to write everything in assembly language it would be very difficult to get anything done. So what has developed in modern computing is a system of higher-level programming languages that are human readable (with practice) that get converted into machine code by specialized translators called <b>compilers</b>. Thus, all of the programming lanuages that you commonly think of like C, Fortran, Python, Java, etc. have specialized vocabulary for common tasks like addition, matrix multiplication, writing files, and generating pictures, that the associated <b>compiler</b> knows how to turn into machine code for the computer to execute. \n",

We didn't tell the computer where to put those, we left it up to Python's interpreter (a behind the scenes compiler) and the system's operating system (which actually executed the compiled program) to just figure out whether to put those in RAM or on the disk drive, and to do it in a manner that didn't conflict with other things that might be saved in those places. \n",

    "- How did the computer know that `1` and `2` were integers? How did it know that we didn't mean `1.0` and `2.0` (floats), or `\"1\"` and `\"2\"` (strings)? That's a convention of the language and you have to play by its rules. In Python, a number without a decimal is interpreted as an integer and anything inside of single (`''`) or double (`\"\"`) quotes is a string. In other languages you need to be more explicit.\n",

    "- Finally, at what point did the human-readable commands above (source-code) get turned into machine code? Part of the reason that Python is so useful is because this intermediate step is handled behind the scenes by an <b>interpreter</b> and a specialized Python compiler. In other languages, compiling source-code is a separate step and you need to be careful how you do it. In Python, this is handled behind the scenes for you. This is why Python is sometimes called an <b>interpreted</b> language versus a <b>compiled</b> language. But these distinctions and how they apply to Python are way beyond what you need to know right now. Just know that Python handles the compilation of the commands you write behind the scenes which liberates you to focus on your code.

    "In Python, objects are one thing and their <b>pointers</b> (you might want to call them labels or variables) are another.  As I told you above in the case of `a=1`, the integer was created somewhere in the available memory and we attached the pointer `a` to it so that we could use it later. Python automatically \"knew\" that we meant `1` to be an integer by convention. That is, the <b>type</b> of `1` was determined to be an integer on the fly. We call this aspect of a language \"dynamic typing\" and it means that the user doesn’t need to explicitly specify the <b>type</b> of an object. This can be a surprise for someone coming from the C-family or Fortran programming languages. \n",
    "\n",

After the second line, a string `'one'` is created in memory and the pointer `a` now points to it. If the `1` initialized in memory isn’t used for a while, a <b>garbage collector</b> comes around and automatically deletes it from memory. In languages like C it is up to the user to allocate and release memory, but in Python the <b>garbage collector</b> (this is actually what it is called) periodically deletes things once the program you are executing no longer references them. In a notebook, like this, objects will typically persist indefinitely, but when running a .py file they will be deleted more methodically. This all happens behind the scenes, because of the hard work of the Python developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong typing ###\n",
    "Even though Python determines object <b>types</b> dynamically when they are created, the object <b>type</b> is fixed. We call this aspect of a programming language <b>strong typing</b>. In practical terms, all that this means is that Python will throw an error if you try and do something with an object that it is incapable of. Python <i>will not</i> try to convert the object to a different <b>type</b> in order for your code to make sense. Thus, `a` in the example above might be alternately assigned to an integer or a string, but operations on the object that `a` points to must be consistent with that object. The compiler won’t guess your intentions. For example"

    "### Data types ###\n",
    "We've partly covered this but let's be comprehensive. We'll refer to <b>objects</b> as anything that is stored in memory and <b>data</b> as special types of objects that are single values. Data objects are the most elementary of the objects we will work with in Python and more complicated objects like functions and structures will use data objects as inputs. The basic data types that we commonly work with are `int`, `float`, `string`, `complex`, and `boolean`. Python can handle all of these natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>int</strong>: integers are whole numbers (no decimal places). Python automatically interprets any number specified without a decimal place as an integer (e.g., `1`,`3`,`100001`, and `0` are all integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>float</strong>: floats are decimal numbers. Python automatically interprets any number specified with a decimal as a float (e.g., `1.`, `1.0`, and `1.00000` all refer to the same float). Behind the scenes floats are stored as the closest binary fraction of a fixed length. What this means is that numbers like `1.0/3.0`, are not exactly one-third, but a truncated approximation of one-third. In many practical cases, this limited precision may not matter, but you need to be aware of it or you might get counter-intuitive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>string</strong>: strings are words, sentences, or anything that you want the computer to interpret \"literally\". Python automatically interprets any characters specified inside single (`''`) or double (`\"\"`) quotes as a string (e.g., `\"blue\"`, `\"words are great\"`, and `\"1.0\"` are all strings, in the last case the numbers are  literally interpreted as their characters rather than their numerical value). Sometimes we'll parse numbers like `\"1.464364363\"` from a file, then we'll convert them to floats and vice versus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>complex</strong>: complex types are imaginary numbers. Python automatically interprets any number written as `a + bJ` as a complex type, where `a` and `b` can be integers or floats (e.g., `1.0 + 1.0J`, `1+ 1J`, and `1 + 1.0J` all specify complex numbers with a real and imaginary component of `1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>boolean</strong>: boolean types are things that have only two values, `True` and `False`. In a lot of applications we need booleans, or at least use them behind the scenes to evaluate whether or not something is true. For example, `1<2` returns the boolean `True`, and `1>2` returns the boolean `False` in Python. `True` and `False` are special values in Python reserved for booleans.\n",

    "\n",
    "- <strong>Example 1</strong>: division of two `int` objects yields a fraction that is not expressible as an `int`. Python upcasts the `int` objects to `float` objects in order to perform the division.

Upcasting can be great if you know what you are doing, but generally it is best practice to explicitly cast your results using the built in type functions. \n",

    "<b>Operators</b> are commands that “operate” on objects to their left and right and return a new object or value. This abstract notion is actually extremely intuitive. For example `+` and `/` are arithmetic operators for addition and division of the objects on either side of the operator. `<` is a logical operator, it returns `True` when the object on the right is larger than the object on the left (Note: logical operators can be used on things that aren't obviously numeric). `is` is another logical operator, it returns `True` when the pointers on the left and right point to the same object, and `False` when they don’t. `is` is similar to `==` (\"equals\"), except that `==` can evaluate to `True` if two different objects evaluate to the same value. Remember, in Python the same object in memory can have multiple pointers, `True` and `False` are common examples. Here are some usage examples\n",

At their most essential, `functions` allow you to reuse chunks of code for operation on new inputs or with tweaks to the parameters associated with the reused code. \n",

    "A `function` is called in Python by using its name followed by parentheses (e.g., `print(1)` calls the `print()` function with the integer `1`). Most, though not all, functions will accept some kind of object as an input. The inputted objects to a function are called its <b>arguments</b>, and these go inside the parentheses. We've seen several examples of `functions` already: `print()`, `int()`, `float()`. These are functions that are standard in Python and can be used by default. `print()` takes in an <b>argument</b> but doesn't <b>return</b> anything. `int()` takes in an object that is convertible to an integer and <b>returns</b> an `int` object.

    "### Indenting ###\n",
    "How did Python know where the function definitions ended? In most programming languages you would use a \"start\" keyword, like \"def\", and a separate \"end\" keyword to let the compiler know that you were finished defining your function. In Python, instead of using \"end\" keywords for the various situations that require them, you instead use indenting to specifify when code is part of the function and when it is part of the rest of the program. Indenting is used in this way anytime you are doing something that seems to logically require an \"end\" statement (e.g., this will figure prominently in the control statements section below). \n",

    "### Namespace ###\n",
    "In the examples above, inside the functions the labels `a` and `b` have one meaning, but outside the functions, we use `a` and `b` to label outputs. How come these don't conflict in some way? <strong>Namespace</strong> is the term used for how programming languages organize object labels. The short answer is that the names for things inside of functions (and later, classes) are actually renamed internally by Python without you knowing it in order to make sure that they don't conflict with labels in the rest of the code. You can make an object \"global\" so that it is accessible everywhere in your code, but this shouldn't be done naively and is beyond the scope of this intro. Also note that when you call a function (e.g., `add(1,3)` in the example above), Python automatically assigns the inputs to the function labels based on position (e.g., `a` and `b` in the case of `add()`), you don't have to manually do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope ###\n",
    "Similar to namespace, <strong>scope</strong> refers to which objects can be accessed by different parts of your program. For example, a `function` only has access to data objects that are passed as inputs, data objects that are defined in the `function` itself, and other `functions` that have been defined or imported (more on this later) into the program. Likewise, the rest of the program cannot access the objects generated by a `function` unless they are returned and given labels. On the other hand, a function has access to other functions that have already been defined in the program or are built-in to Python. For example:  "

    "\n",
    "- <strong>tuple</strong>: tuples are structures that store data in <b>order</b> but are <b>immutable</b>. That is tuples are like lists, except that you can't add or remove from them without creating a whole new object in memory. Sometimes you need things that are immutable (e.g., the next two structures require immutable objects!). Defined using `()` (check examples below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>set</strong>: sets are like lists but they are <b>unordered</b> and no duplicates are allowed. Unordered? Yes, sets collect objects but don't keep track of where they were put. On a technical side, it is actually more accurate to say that sets are hyperspecific about where they’ve put things (internally) and so you as the user cannot modify that order. This makes sets very efficient at calculating membership (e.g., is \"1\" in our set?) and intersections (common objects in multiple sets). If you wanted to know if the numbers 7,23,and 108 existed in three lists or three sets, it would be much faster to do the latter. Defined using `{}` or `set(list)` notation. (check examples below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>dictionary</strong>: dictionaries are structures that store objects in pairs. Each pair consists of a <b>key</b> and a <b>value</b>. In analogy, a phone book is a dictionary, where the key is a person's name, and the value their phone number. You could accomplish the same thing using two sets of ordered lists, but dictionaries have the advantage that their keys are stored...as...a...<b>set</b>! Returning to our phonebook example, this would make it really easy to figure out if someone is in the phonebook (otherwise you would need to read every name). It also means that there can't be two identical keys in your dictionary. Defined with `{}` notation with `key:value` pairs. (check examples below)\n",

You can use slice notation for accessing objects from any ordered data structure (e.g., `tuple`). \n",

    "## Control Statements ##\n",
    "\n",
    "We motivated the introduction of data structures by saying that it is difficult to do anything useful if you are limited to dealing with individual datum. Similarly, it is difficult to construct useful programs if you have to hard code every individual action you want to do. We will often want to perform the same action many times (<b>for</b>/<b>while</b> loops), or perform an action only under certain circumstances (<b>if</b>/<b>elif</b>/<b>else</b> logic), or will want to attempt something and if it fails implement a fallback plan (<b>try</b>/<b>except</b> logic), or some combination of all three. The tools that accomplish these feats are <b>control statements</b>. These are built into python, and they are so useful that every language has them in some form. We'll quickly run through the definitions of each of these then demonstrate their usefulness with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>for</strong>: You will use `for` whenever you need to do something \"`for` every `x` in `y`\", where `x` is an object and `y` is something like a `list` that potentially holds many objects. In a strict sense you can use `for` on any object that is <b>iterable</b>, which means the object has rules for what to do when `for` operates on it. For example, many built-in python objects are iterable, including `strings` (for loops over their individual characters), although their iteration rules might not be obvious without experimentation. The standard construction of a `for` loop is `for variable in iterable:` where `variable` is a convenient name for the objects returned by the iterable, and `iterable` is the pointer to an iterable object or an iterable defined directly in the `for` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>while</strong>: You will use `while` whenever you need to do something repeatedly \"`while` `x` is `True`\", where `x` is a condition (e.g., `len(x) > 0`) and `True` is a boolean. In practice, `while` and `for` loops are redundant, although it is sometimes easier to do something in one than the other. The standard construction of a `while` loop is `while condition:` where `condition` is an expression that evaluates to a boolean. As long as `condition` evaluates to `True`, the loop will run again. A valid `condition` would be `x is False`, which would evaluate to `True` (you might need to think about this a little bit, but it becomes intuitive very quickly).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>if/elif/else</strong>: You will use `if` (and possibly `elif` and `else`) when you want to do something \"only `if` `x` is `True`\", where `x` is a condition (e.g., `x is False`) and `True` is a boolean. This is kind of like `while` except that `if` statements are only evaluated once, not repeatedly until they evaluate to `False`. If the condition `x` evaluates to `False` then the commands inside of `if` do not get executed. This isn't the end of the story, a lot of the time we want to provide instructions along the lines of \"if not a then do b\", or \"if not a and if not b, then do c\" or \"if not ... a bunch of conditions... do this\". To accomplish this, `if` comes with two optional partners. The first is `elif` which is a portmanteu of \"else\" and \"if\". You will use `elif` when you want to test an addition condition `y` when the `if` condition evaluated to `False`. In words, a typical situation would be \"if x do a; elif y: do b\", where the `elif` condition would <emph>only</emph> be evaluated when the `if` condition evaluates to `False`. The second partner is `else`, which you would use for \"do this when everything else has evaluated to `False`. Thus, `else` contains commands that only run when all of the preceeding `if` and `elif` statements have evaluated to `False`. Both `elif` and `else` are optional. You can use `if` alone, in which case if the conditional expression evaluates to `False`, the implied `else` is \"do nothing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>try/except</strong>: You will use `try` and its complementary statement `except` when you want to \"try `x` and if it fails do `exception`\". This sounds a lot like `if` and `else`, and it is, except that you don't test anything in the `try` statement. `try` and `except` have a distinctly pythonic flavor, encapsulated in the epigram \"it is better to ask forgiveness than permission\". This means that it is sometimes better to just attempt it, than to do a preliminary test to check if you should. This can lead to significant efficiency gains in some applications. Logically, `try` and `except` are nearly redundant with `if` and `else`, so you can get by without using them initially, but you really should become practiced with them since some exceptions are easier to catch than to test for in advance, and there are some situations where `if` and `else` are not equivalent, like when information is time sensitive--for instance, between the time an `if` statement evaluates to `True` and the code being evaluated something might have changed that leads the code to fail--using try and except makes your code robust to these kinds of situations. Note, `else` and `finally` are also complements to `try` but I'm intentionally not covering their use here. \n",

The join method will put an instance of the string that it is called on between each string in the list. In the first case, the parent string is `''`, or an \"empty string\", which results in no spaces. In the second and third cases, a space and `...` are inserted, respectively.

We highlighted a small number of methods that belong to these classes that are standard to these objects because python developers knew that people commonly need to do certain kinds of things with their `strings`, `lists`, etc. In general applications, you may find that you want to create your own classes, with certain attributes and methods beyond those that are available through other libraries or standard python distributions.
