    "### Introduction ###\n",
    "So you're working for a BIG company, you have a bunch of data ($\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}$) for a core company process (these might be vectors of many inputs and outputs), and you would like to generate model(s) of this process using an extravagent number of parameters ($\\mathbf{\\beta}$). You have a meeting in an hour and you want to impress your boss with a nice curve that runs through your very complicated data, so you set up a complicated function based on every input you could imagine, and try to minimize the error\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_\\mathrm{i}\\left( f(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{i},\\mathbf{\\beta}}) - y_\\mathrm{i} \\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, your inputs ($\\mathbf{x}$), outputs ($\\mathbf{y}$), and parameters ($\\mathbf{\\beta}$) are really high dimensional, so you pull out the big guns (the clock is ticking and you have people to IMPRESS). You slap your model into scikit-learn and magically you watch your error fall down down down (maybe too far?). scikit-learn returns the parameters that have minimized this error, and you walk into your meeting armed with an impressive curve that is almost certainly overfit. You will owe the (undeserved) admiration of your peers to an optimization algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern machine learning is built on top of optimization algorithms. When you are first starting to build models, you would be surprised how much you can do using packages like skikit-learn, and treating their training algorithms as as a black-box. The reason this is possible (and the reason this can get you into trouble) is because of the availability of a broad suite of optimization algorithms that can find minima of high dimensional functions (i.e., the parameters in your model that usually minimize your objective function under some constraint). Here we will go through three fundamental algorithms, <b>gradient descent (GD)</b>, <b>stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</b>, <b> gradient descent with momentum</b>. Once you have the feeling for these, we'll illustrated the use of some other algorithms and present some intuition for their use, without going into as much detail regarding their actual implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent (GD) is the simplest entry point to optimization and it is the parent from which many more sophisticated algorithms are derived. If you find yourself in some mountains and you know home is at the bottom of the valley, what do you do? You could potentially use a lot of information: the sun's position, the visible terrain, or you might use a radio to communicate with other hikers and try to triangulate your position. Different optimization methods are largely distinguished <i>by what kind of information they utilize</i> while trying to find the minimum of a function (i.e., home and the mountains respectively in this example). In <b>gradient descent</b> we decide that we will only use the local gradient to make our next move. Every so often we'll survey the ground <emph>right beneath our feet</emph> and change our direction based on the direction that leads most steeply downhill. This isn't too crazy: we want to get to the bottom of the mountain, so the fastest way might be to always follow the steepest downward direction. Algorithmically, this takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i} - \\alpha \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)$ indicates the <b>gradient</b> (or vector of partial derivatives with respect to each parameter, $\\beta_\\mathrm{j}$, think through the 1d case to rationalize the minus sign).  Here, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}$ is a vector of the model parameters, at the \"i-th\" step. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is acting just like a coordinate system (e.g., x,y,z) and we are nagivating these coordinates looking for a minimum. Lastly, $\\alpha$ is a <b>step</b> parameter, or \"<b>learning rate</b>\", which determines how far to step in parameter space before checking the gradient again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a working algorithm we still have to account for how to start and finish. Starting is easy, we make it the responsibility of the user to give a $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{0}$ as an initial guess. As discussed in the lecture notes, for a convex objective function the final solution isn't sensitive to the initial guess, but a bad guess will take longer to converge. For a non-convex objective function, the final solution can be sensitive to the intitial guess and this will motivate some of the later modifications we'll make to this algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "For stopping there are several options. The most general is to stop once the change in $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ becomes small (e.g., $||\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i+1}||_{2}<\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a problem specific value and $||\\cdot||_{2}$ is the L2 norm). As discussed in class, we will commonly be concerned with overfitting when we are training models. A second stopping criteria we might use might be based on the value of the objective function for a witheld validation dataset. The last criteria you will encounter is a practical one: simply stop after a fixed number of steps. This is commonly used when the objective function is very expensive to calculate, or if you are afraid of overfitting and just want an estimated solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a generic gradient descent algorithm (with two of the three stopping options):"

In simple terms, this means that the parameter surface forms a big bowl with only a single minimum. For non-linear problems (which are of most interest in ML research) initial guess dependencies are a common challenge. Stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum both partly address initial guess dependencies, but in a heuristic rather than guaranteed fashion. \n",

    "#### Problems with Gradient Descent ####\n",
    "Now that you've seen gradient descent in action, I want to point out some obvious shortcomings of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Problem 1:</b> If we have a lot of data then evaluating the gradient can quickly become very expensive. Approximate gradient evaluations might be very useful for problems with lots of data.\n",
    "- <b>Problem 2:</b> The algorithm <b>only</b> uses the local gradient for deciding how to update the parameters. The algorithm doesn't use the second derivative or knowledge about the previous updates, which might be potentially valuable sources of information.\n",
    "- <b>Problem 3:</b> The algorithm uses a fixed learning rate, $\\alpha$, that is the same for all of the parameters. Based on the unnormalized parameterization example, we might anticipate that different parameters might benefit from distinct learning rates (i.e., $\\alpha$ could be a vector rather than a scalar).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these three problems motivate the specific extensions to gradient descent that will be covered below. Specifically, we'll introduce the \"stochastic\" modification which will make our gradient evaluations much less expensive (addresses problem 1). We'll then introduce the concept of momentum that will elegantly incorporate information from previous updates (one solution to problem 2). Finally, we'll introduce versions of gradient descent with adaptive learning rates that will change the learning rate for each parameter based upon its partial derivative at each step (addresses problem 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent ###\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful variant of gradient descent is <b>stochastic</b> gradient descent. You may have noticed that to calculate the gradient over the whole data set was our most costly step, since it involved a loop over all of the data. In more complicated applications (say where we have hundreds of millions of samples) calculating the gradient using all of the data at every step might even become impossible for typical hardware. In stochastic gradient descent, instead of using all of the data, we use a single randomly selected sample to approximate the gradient at each step. The corresponding equation for the update is identical to regular gradient descent, except that the gradient is now evaluated with respect to a single sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\mathrm{i+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\mathrm{i} - \\alpha \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{j\\in N}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\mathrm{i}\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the $j\\in N$ notation indicates a single sample ($j$) randomly chosen from the $N$ available. To modify our existing GD implementation, we will need to (1) update our gradient evaluation function so that it accepts a sample index to evaluate the gradient with respect to, and (2) add a random number generator so that each time the gradient is called a different index is used:\n"

    "There are a few interesting comparisons with regular gradient descent. First, we observe that we obtain a pretty good solution very quickly. For example, after a single iteration through the data, the solution is close to the non-stochastic solution while costing much less to evaluate the derivate. Second, we can use the standardization trick with any optimizer. For many models standardization of the features is critical, whereas I don't know of any case where it hurts. This is especially true of deep learning models where standardization is a prerequisite for effectively training activation functions. Third, we observe that more iterations eventually lead to oscillations about the correct solution, but not necessarily an improved answer (experiment with the above cell using more iterations for SGD to see this clearly). This is because of the interplay between the stochastic element and the learning rate ($\\alpha$). A large learning rate increases convergence initially, but then limits convergence near the real solution as random sampling leads to oscillations in the minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE</b>: Standardization would benefit all of the examples in this notebook. I don't standardize the remaining examples purely for the sake of illustrating the different behaviors of the algorithms. Data standardization often helps non-linear model parameterization, is required by some model architectures, and it is typical to see standardization adopted by default. But it isn't universally advantageous (because you are in fact losing information when you standardize) so be aware of its limitations. \n",

For instance, in the current example it seems optimal to start with a relatively large learning rate, while reducing it as we get closer to the actual solution. There are many different learning schedules that you will see implemented in the literature (see the lecture notes for additional examples). \n",

In SGD, remember that every epoch actually consists of `N` updates, which is responsible for the appearance of cutting the corner. \n",

Let's suppose that we could use independent learning rates for `a` and `b`. Which one would you want to be larger and which one would you want to be smaller? \n",
    "\n",

More generally, the gradients might vary dramatically over the course of the optimization, and we might want to update the learning rates as we go using this information. These concepts (i.e., parameter specific learning rates and learning rates that change based on the optimization surface) are known as <b>adaptive learning rates</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) ####\n",
    "The first extension to gradient descent that we'll cover that is motivated by adaptive learning rates is <b>AdaGrad</b>. AdaGrad implements parameter specific learning rates that are updated at each step based on the local gradient with respect to each parameter. We will still have a base learning rate $\\alpha$ but parameters with large gradients will scale this rate to be smaller, and parameters with small gradients will scale this rate to be larger. The form of the update is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{A}_\\mathrm{i+1} = \\mathbf{A}_\\mathrm{i} + \\mathrm{diag}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\beta_\\mathrm{i}\\right)\\right]^2 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i} - \\frac{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{A}_\\mathrm{i+1}}+\\mathrm{diag}\\left(\\varepsilon\\right)} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{A}$ is the quantity that governs the update to the effective learning rate and $\\alpha$ is a base learning rate. $\\mathrm{diag}()$ refers to a diagonal matrix with zeroes for the off-diagonal elements. Thus $\\mathrm{diag}\\left[\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}\\right)\\right]^2$ has the square of each partial derivative along the diagonal of the matrix. We use the square because we care about the magnitude of the gradient, not its sign. In the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, $\\mathbf{A}$ appears in the denominator, and we take the square root. Dividing by a matrix isn't valid linear algebra, but here the notation is used to indicate the dot product between the inverse of the diagonal matrix in the denominator with the $\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\beta}f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\mathrm{i}\\right)$ vector. Finally, $\\varepsilon$ is typically a small fixed value (e.g., 1E-4) and the $\\mathrm{diag}\\left(\\varepsilon\\right)$ matrix is used with to avoid division by zero if elements in $\\mathbf{A}$ are too small. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of text went into explaining the AdaGrad equations, but the modification is actually very intuitive. At each step, the effective learning rate for each parameter is the base learning rate divided by the (cumulative) magnitude of its partial derivative. For parameters with small gradients, this increases the effective learning rate, for parameters with large gradients, this decreases the effective learning rate. That's really all there is to it, the $\\varepsilon$ thing is just to deal with pathological cases. Likewise, we use diagonal matrices, because the square root can be easily calculated. However, \"full-matrix\" extensions to adagrad are actively researched, but won't be covered here. Since we are only using the diagonal of the $\\mathbf{A}$ here, you could also just think of $\\mathbf{A}$ as being a vector and the division as being element-wise, but I have used the $\\mathrm{diag}(\\mathbf{A})$ form to imply the generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still paying attention, you can also see a potential problem with AdaGrad, in that the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ just keeps getting bigger and bigger (and correspondingly, the effective learning rate will monotonically decrease). For this reason AdaGrad is prone to stopping too early and we'll address that with our next adaptive learning rate algorithm (rmsprop). \n",

The next result is that the optimization moves more directly towards the minimum compared with the other algorithms. (Experiment with the above cell to get a feel for the behavior of AdaGrad).\n",
